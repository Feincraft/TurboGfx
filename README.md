# TurboGfx - PowerApps SVG Control
SVG Editor control for PowerApps


A PCF control that makes it easy to import scalable graphics (SVG) to PowerApps.
Includes a built-in SVG editor with support for variables, enabling end users to control shapes within the image using standard controls.
The control is built entirely in PowerApps Studio, provided with a demo app or as a standalone component.
